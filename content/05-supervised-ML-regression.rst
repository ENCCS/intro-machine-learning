Regression is a type of supervised ML task where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value based on input features. Unlike classification, which assigns inputs to discrete categories, regression models output real-valued predictions.

While the penguins dataset is most commonly used for classification tasks, it can also be used for regression problems by selecting a continuous target variable. For example, we might be interested in predicting a penguinâ€™s body mass based on its physical measurements like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and other available features.
