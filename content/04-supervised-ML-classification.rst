Classification is a supervised ML task where the model predicts discrete class labels based on input features. 
It involves training a model on labeled data so that it can assign new data to predefined categories or classes based on patterns learned from labeled training data.

In binary classification, models predict one of two classes, such as spam or not spam for emails. Multiclass classification extends this to multiple categories, like classifying images as cats, dogs, or birds.

Common algorithms for classification task include k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), logistic Regression, decision tree, random forest, naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting, and neural networks.

In this episode we will perform the supervised classification tasks by
