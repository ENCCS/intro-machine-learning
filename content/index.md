# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a rapidly growing field within artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data.
Instead of being explicitly programmed with detailed rules, machine learning models identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on historical data.
This approach has revolutionized many industries, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and technology, enabling applications like personalized recommendations, fraud detection, and speech recognition.
As the volume of data continues to grow, understanding machine learning concepts and techniques becomes increasingly important for anyone interested in working with data or building intelligent systems.

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and techniques of machine learning.
We will cover essential topics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and model evaluation, as well as the basics of data preprocessing and feature selection.
The participants will learn how to design and implement basic machine learning models using tools and frameworks commonly used in the industry.
Through a combination of theory, practical exercises, and real-world examples, the participants will gain a solid foundation in machine learning, preparing them for further study or practical application in various domains.

By the end of the course, students will understand how machine learning models are built, how to select the appropriate algorithms for specific problems, and how to assess model performance.
They will be equipped with the skills to work on machine learning projects, from data collection and preparation to model training and evaluation.
This knowledge will serve as a valuable stepping stone for those wishing to explore more advanced topics or specialize in areas such as deep learning, natural language processing, or computer vision.
