What is Machine Learning
------------------------

Machine learning (ML) is a field of computer science that studies algorithms and techniques for automating solutions to complex problems that are hard to program using conventional programing methods.

In conventional programming, the programmer explicitly codes the logic (rules) to transform inputs (data) into outputs (answers), making it suitable for well-defined, rule-based tasks.
In ML, the system learns the logic (rules) from data and answers, making it ideal for complex, pattern-based tasks where explicit rules are hard to define. The choice between them depends on the problem, data availability, and complexity.
